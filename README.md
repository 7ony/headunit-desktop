# HeadUnit Desktop

What is this?
-------------
HeadUnit Desktop is a based free and open source software that is intended to be run on computers built into cars. This software is currently under active development and lot of the features are experimental. As of now there are two main features: 

 - Media player with a media library and media scanner
 - Android Autoâ„¢ client

Proposed features:

 - FM and DAB radio
 - CAN bus sniffer (depending on how much control different modules of the car allow and how much information, such as A/C steering wheel controls, different gauges and sensor data) with a customizable profile for each car.

The GUI for some of the proposed features is already there. For screenshots of the current state of the GUI [go to the screenshots page.](http://headunit.viktorgino.me/SCREENSHOTS)

API documentation
----------------------------

There is an API documentation available at [http://headunit.viktorgino.me/html/index.html](http://headunit.viktorgino.me/html/index.html) within the docs you will find more information about the implementation details of this project. 

How to get the code working?
----------------------------

For instruction on to get it setup on a Raspberry Pi and Raspbian [click here](https://github.com/viktorgino/headunit/blob/master/RPi_instructions.md).
Install QT5 and you will probably want to install QT Creator with it as well. You can get it with apt-get:

    sudo apt-get install qtcreator

This should install all the files required to get started with developing QT, but it is very likely, that you will get an outdated version of it so get it from the official site [https://www.qt.io/download-open-source](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)
After you've installed Qt add its libraries to the library load path to make things easier. On Ubuntu/Debian x64 just add the following line to /etc/ld.so.conf/x86_64-linux-gnu.conf :

    /DIR_TO_QT/Qt/5.x/gcc_64/lib

Install the following packages:

    libusb-1.0-0-dev libssl-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base-apps gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav libboost-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev 

**Build and install QtGStreamer**

Get the latest code for QtGStreamer from [https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/qt-gstreamer](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/qt-gstreamer) configure it with CMake and install it on your system. Most of the build steps are detailed in its README file. You might want to install cmake-qt-gui to make it easier:

    sudo apt-get install cmake-qt-gui

With the cmake gui installed just open the folder where you've cloned the qt-gstreamer git, specify where you want to build it (I just used the same dir as it makes generating the Doxygen document easier) and click generate (if it throws up an error message just correct it). You will need tell cmake to use QT5:

    -DQT_VERSION=5
    -CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std=c++11
   After succesfully generating the make file with cmake just open the terminal and cd into the folder you specified as build directory in and run: `make && sudo make install`

After completing the above steps you should be able to build the code with QT Creator an run it. If you have any problem, then reach out to me on XDA Developers [http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6642908](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6642908) or drop me an email on [me@viktorgino.me](me@viktorgino.me)
